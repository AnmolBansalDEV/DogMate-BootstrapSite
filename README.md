# DogMate-BootstrapSite
- This is the site that I created for dogs where they can enroll for a free as well as a paid tier subscription plan for using our app that's basically is a tinder for dogs.
- I made this site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5, following the Angela yu's web development bootcamp.
- I've deployed this website on vercel so, if you're curious you can check that out [here](https://dog-mate-bootstrap-site.vercel.app/)
